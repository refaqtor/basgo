
DROGANYA.TOK is the original tokenized version for BASICA,
DROGANYA.BAS is the same stuff written out in ASCII.

These two versions do not run under GW-BASIC or QBASIC ("out of memory").
Comments and line numbers take up program space in BASIC, so Nathan Glasser
renumbered the program with shorter line numbers and deleted all the comments
(and fixed a bug found in that process); the result can now be run under
GW-BASIC or QBASIC:

NEWDROG.BAS  is Nathan Glasser's ASCII version for GW-BASIC,
NEWDROG.TOK  is the tokenized version of this,
NEWDROG.QBS  is a slightly modified version for QBASIC
             (modified by Volker Blasius following a suggestion by Ambat Sasi)
