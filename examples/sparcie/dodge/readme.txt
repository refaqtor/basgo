Thanks for downloading my GWBasic game named Dodge.
If you have any comments or feedback please leave them at my blog.

Requirements
------------

Dodge doesn't use any graphics and should work on any system that supports 80x25 character text mode. The basic source 
files require either GWBasic or QBasic to run. It might run on a newer interpreter such as QB64, but this is untested
and unsupported.

You can create your own custom levels, the built-in levels are included as examples. The auxilary program mapgen is a simple 
map auto generator and the other program map2data encodes level data from a file into the RLE data format used for built in levels.

Notes
-----
I've included the notes I made whilst writing the code. I didn't really use comments in the code as I was documenting it within
these notes. They are a bit rough and ready, but should let you know the rough structure of the game code.

Dodge is Public Domain, you may do whatever the heck you want with it. This was after all a project for fun.
